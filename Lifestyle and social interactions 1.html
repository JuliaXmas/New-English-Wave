                    Role of Globalization:<br>
                        1. Explain how globalization affects family roles and structures (e.g., migration, work opportunities abroad).<br>
                        2. Positive impacts: exposure to different cultures, economic opportunities.<br>
                        3. Negative impacts: separation from extended family, cultural dilution.<br>

            <p class="sample-text traditions">
                Family traditions play a significant role in American culture, providing a sense of continuity, identity, and connection between generations. These traditions can range from simple rituals like Sunday dinners or annual vacations to more elaborate celebrations like holiday gatherings or milestone events.
                One common tradition in American families is the celebration of Thanksgiving, where loved ones come together to share a meal and express gratitude for their blessings. Families often have their own unique customs for this holiday, such as watching the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, playing touch football in the yard, or going around the table and sharing what they are thankful for.
                Another popular tradition is decorating the Christmas tree together as a family. This festive activity often involves unpacking treasured ornaments and reminiscing about the memories attached to each one. Families may also have traditions like baking cookies for Santa, attending a Christmas Eve church service, or exchanging handmade gifts on Christmas morning.
                Some families have traditions that center around birthdays, such as making a special breakfast in bed for the birthday person or hosting a themed party with friends and family. Others may have traditions related to cultural or religious events, like lighting the menorah for Hanukkah or fasting during Ramadan.
